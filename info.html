		In this section i have included some links to projects i have undertaken to cement what i have learned so far. As you can probably tell this web site is unfinished and has been a work in progress as i continue my coding journey. I am hoping that one day i can use all i have learned and will learn to gain a job in either program design web design or any other coding based jobs available. I am interested in all areas of coding and really enjoy learning all languages and putting them into pracital application below are a few projects i have worked on recently. and also links to my different learning sites and profiles.</p>
