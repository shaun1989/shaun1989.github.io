				<h2 align = "center" class = "h2">more info on the page</h2>
				<p id = "p6" align = "center">in this section i will explain a bit about the pages and the purpose of this site. i have created this site as a project mainly to cement the languages and tricks i have currently learned in my coding journey. And also as a bit of a help tool for poeple who are like me just getting started and are interested in writing code. I dont know everything obvs but as i have been learning code for a while now and recently came across the mocroverse website and decided to take the pre course. This sites information is mainly aimed at what will be needed when starting out on the pre course. I found i had some issues that took some research to solve and im hoping this site could possibly take away some of the hassle of googling everything if any one gets stuck.</p>
				<br />
				<p id = "p7"><strong>the home page/- </strong> this page is mainly an info page and is also designed to be an info page and more of a quick search page for each of the steps you will need to take on the first part of the course E:G getting familier with the command line.</p>
				<p id = "p7"><strong>the links page/- </strong> the links page is full of useful links for downloads such as os downloads for virtual box aswell as links to pages that focus on actually learning code as there are alot of great sites available and you can choose the best one suited to you i have spent a year cycling between these sites and i feel i have greatly benefited from them all.</p>
				<p id = "p7"><strong>the ruby install guide/- </strong> The ruby install guide is a full version guide for step 1 of the microverse pre course as i found i had to take a few extra steps to make mine all run smoothly so i included them in my guide Incase any one else gets stuck. It includes full install gide of rvm,ruby,rails,updates,heroku,and the ssh key needed to link to your github and heroku account</p>
				<p id = "p7"><strong>the os install guide/- </strong>this guide wil help you install the desired operating system for your coding journey as most find virtual machines make life easier when either coding or starting to code as you can choose any operating system you would like to do all of your work on and the command lines on different systems work differently. i personally use linux mint19 and it works really well for me.</p>
				<p id = "p7"><strong>the git basics page/- </strong>this page is just a short guide on how git and github work and how to navigate your work from your computer to your github repository.</p>
